            <h1>chakra visualization method: </h1>
            <h5>- While lying down with your eyes closed, imagine a glowing orb floating in front of the bottoms of your feet. Now, imagine that orb being warm and transferring its warmth to the bottoms of your feet. begin to imagine that warmth traveling from your feet and up your legs until your entire body is filled with a cozy warmth all over.</h5>
            <h5>- Now move your attention to the base of your spine and imagine a red ball of light resting at the base of your spine. Focus on the color red and try imagining objects that relate to the color red, like an apple. Allow your mind to be filled with red light energy. Return your focus to the red ball of light at the base of your spine. THis ball of light represents your root chakra. Imagine the red ball of light beginning to spin and grow until your whole body is wrapped in red light. Now imagine the red light providing your root chakra with everything it needs to be balanced.</h5>
            <h5>- Now allow the red light to slowly reduce in size until it has returned to its original small ball of light at the base of your spine, and then slowly fade out.</h5>
            <h5>- Next, imagine an orange ball of light appearing 4 or 5 inches up on your spine, corresponding with the location of your belly button. This is your sacral chakra. repeat the same process with this chakra as you did the root chakra, only change the color and the related objects you imagine. I like to stick with fruit as my objects to relate the color to since there are fruits for each of the chakra colors. So with the sacral chakra, I imagine an orange.</h5>
            <h5>- After the sacral chakra, you will simply repeat the same steps for the remaining chakras and their corresponding colors. The next chakra is the solar plexus chakra just below your chest, 4 or 5 inches above your belly button, and it is yellow, like a lemon. Then you will do the heart chakra located at the top of your chest and glowing a green light, like a lime. Following the heart chakra is the throat chakra loacted at the top of your throat just below your chin and it is blue like a blue raspberry. THen is the third eye chakra right in the middle of your forehead, and it is also blue, but a deeper indigo blue, like a blueberry. Finally, you will repeat the process with the last chakra, the crown chakra which sits right on top of your head and is deep purple like a concord grape.</h5>
            <h5>- Lastly, now that you have gone through all the chakras, you can imagine that light at the bottom of your feet continuing to send cozy warmth up your feet and charging all the chakra stations with warmth all the way up to the crown chakra and back down, like a circuit of positive energy running up and down your body as you drift off to sleep.</h5>

            <h1>goodnight, everything method:</h1>
            <h5>- This method is a bit simpler than the chakra visualization. Get cozy in your bed and close your eyes. begin to imagine planet earth and the sun and moon. Say goodnight to each of the three cosmic bodies beginning with the sun, then the moon, followed by planet earth.</h5>
            <h5>Next, imagine all the oceans and say goodnight to them, followed by all the continents, ending with the continent where you live. Then imagine your country and say goodnight to it, followed by your state or province, then your city, your neighborhood, and your home.</h5>
            <h5>Finally, you will focus on your body and say goodnight to it and it's parts, beginning with your feet and working your way up to your head. Your body and mind should be able to slip into a nice cozy sleep from here. </h5>
          </div>

            <h1>make room for gratitude method:</h1>
            <h5>This method is really good for times when you are feeling stressed or frustrated. You can use this method to shift your mood to a more positive place which will help you have more restful sleep.</h5>
            <h5>First, get into bed and get comfortable and then close your eyes. Try to empty your mind of fluttering thoughts and just breathe for a few minutes, focusing on each breath as it goes in and out. As your body and mind begin to calm, try to think of the primary cause of your anxiety or frustration. Whatever that situation is, tell it that you will continue to address it the next day after you have rested and slept. Tell it that you are not neglecting it or repressing it, but rather, setting it aside for the night to make room for gratitude. </h5>
            <h5>Now, you can shift your focus to thinking about things you are thankful for, beginning with the most basic and mundane thing you can think of, like being thankful for rest and sleep, or even for your bed. Next, try to think of more personal things you are thankful for, like your friends and loved ones, or your favorite pet.</h5>
            <h5>Finally, dwell on the overall nature of gratitude and express thankfulness toward the universe and focus in on allowing that gratitude to wash over your entire mind and body as you fall asleep and believe that the positive energy you gain from all that you are thankful for will energize your ability to navigate the stresses of life of when you wake up. </h5>

            <h1>custom method - choose you own adventure:</h1>
            <h5>You can also always customize your meditation technique. You can look at the above examples and apply aspects of them to your own approach, or you can try out your own completely different methods. Some people like to just simply focus on their breathing, and other people enjoy coming up with an elborate visualization meditation that is specifically meaningful to their life and values. There are not any rules, though it is recommended that you try to keep your method calming and not focus on things that cause you any anxiety.</h5>
